# Title (Regex-Tutorial)

Introductory paragraph (In this tutorial you will learn about the regular expressions. regular expresions are are special strings representing a pattern to be matched in a search operation. a regex is a string of text that allows you to create patterns that help match, locate, and manage text.)

## Wikipedia definition
A regular expression is a sequence of characters that specifies a search pattern. Usually such patterns are used by string-searching algorithms for "find" or "find and replace" operations on strings, or for input validation. It is a technique developed in theoretical computer science and formal language theory.

## Summary

Briefly summarize the regex you will be describing and what you will explain. Include a code snippet of the regex. Replace this text with your summary.

## Regex Components

### Anchors
When working with regular expressions, you can use an anchor to state that a match must occur in a specific position. Anchors can be used to ensure that matches are found at the start or end of the source string, or at the start of end of a line in multi-line text.

### Quantifiers
Quantifiers specify how many instances of a character, group, or character class must be present in the input for a match to be found. The following table lists the quantifiers supported by .NET.
